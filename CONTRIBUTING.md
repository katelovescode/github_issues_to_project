# Contributing

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

See our [open issues](https://github.com/katelovescode/github_issues_to_project/issues) for existing requests. I'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors w/ the `good first issue` tag.  The `help wanted` tag is also a good one to look for.

One way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated.

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. When contributing to this repository with a pull request, please fill out the pull request template as completely as is reasonable. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to merge) and either merged into `main` or given feedback for requested changes.

## Workflow

When you're ready to start working on an issue:  

- Visit the [issues list](https://github.com/katelovescode/github_issues_to_project/issues) and find something you'd like to work on
- Comment on the issue that you'll be working on it
- Branch from `main` and, if needed, rebase to the current `main` branch before submitting your pull request
- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature
- When your code is ready, make a pull request to `main` using the PR template; please use "Closes #[num]" phrasing to automatically close the issue when your PR is merged
- When you have one approval, one of the admins will merge.  If changes are requested, the review will state the changes needed.
